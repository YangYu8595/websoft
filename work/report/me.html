<h1>My report page in the course DA377B</h1>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Yang Yu, born in ZheJiang Province, China. I am 22 years old now and I will graduate next year. I am an exchange student in Kristianstad University and I like this area so much.</p>

<p>Programming has not been an interest of mine, until I entered University and I found that it was really interesting.</p>

<p>If I should mention a hobby, besides web programming, then it would be to remove and carry stones on my sommer cottage. There is a lot of stone there.</p>

<p>On and off I try new hobbies, one year it was online poker, another year it was Geocaching and the Turfing. Currently I am available to start up new hobbies so lets se what might turn up.</p>

<p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
