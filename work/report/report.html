I know about techniques Git,GitHub,Markdown and GitHub Pages before, and I have tried to create websites before. My former github web page is https://y85959948.github.io/test/. However, it is written in Chinese not English. I think building a web applicaiton is very interesting. It is not so hard for beginners, so it will much easier for us to do that than some other appliacitons. Today I review how to work with Git and GitHub, which is really useful for our future work. What is more, I learn to fork repo from other github developers, which is a basic way to study other's ideas. In addition, learning update my forked repo is also important. Finally, I must say thanks to GitHub. Thanks to GitHub that I can setup a website using GitHub Pages, which will benefit us a lot!

<h2>S02</h2>

I have tried HTML and CSS before, but not JavaScript. As you can see in my former website, I use some HTML and CSS. I think HTML is the basic of a website, CSS and JavaScript serve for HTML. Because website can not be built without HTML, but can be built without CSS or JavaScript. In my opinion, I think web server is always waiting for interacting. When a browser wants to interact with web server, it will send a request using HTTP protocol. After that, web server will send response to web browser. Finally, the browser and web server can interacts with each other. Today the most important thing I learned is how to use CSS and JavaScript with HTML. Because CSS and JavaScript especially JavaScript is really import in network programming. And CSS is more and more significant in website decoration. I think CSS is much more difficult than JavaScript, because it has a lot of parameters and it is not easy for beginners to use.

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>
I do not have any previous experience of client side JavaScript before. It is my first time to use JavaScript for client side. I think JavaScript is an amazing programming language that it can make our website much more meaningful. However, JavaScript can not be used without HTML during website implement, while some other languages such as PHP, HTML. I think my coding exercise today is not easy. Because my grade aim is 5, however, I think maybe my code could only turned out to be 4. The reason is that I have much more difficult for solving the require 5. Today I have learned how to implement client side using JavaScript, which makes client side much more meaningful. What is more, I have some difficult in fetching data from other website, which will cause No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' problem.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>
I think working with JavaScript, Node and Express is not easy, because I am not familiar with these things. To be honest, I do not have a specific plan, I just do the tasks that the lab requires, and I find that this lab is pretty difficult, because it is my first time to try this kind of framwork. Although my aim for the grade is 5, I think I can only get 3 point. I think it is not difficult for us to get 3, however, I think it is not easy to get 4 or more, because I just could not understand the requirement that this lab asks. Today I learned a lot about JavaScript for server side. What is more, I am getting more and more familiar with Node and Express, which will benefit a lot in the future work. In addition, I must say that this lab is the most difficult one amoung these labs. I think I need to work harder and harder so that I could get great grades.

<h2>S05</h2>

I think PHP is not so difficult compare to JavaScript, maybe because I have tried this language before. I think PHP is a very useful language, as we all know that PHP is the most popular language amoung these website programming languages. It is not difficult for beginners to study and use, so I will recommend it if someone would like to study a website programming language. My aim for this lab is to get 5, because I think this lab is not so difficult and our teacher had showed us how to solve these tasks, so I am satisfied with the result. Today I have learned how to use PHP language to implement CURD operations and set the common header or footer, which is really useful for website build in future work. However, I think I still have a lot need to learn after this lab. It is difficult to finish this lab without teacher's help. Therefore, I need to work harder and harder in order to get great grades.

<h2>S06</h2>

I think the popularity of programming languages is normal because the society today is the age of information science. Therefore, I think it is a trends in the information age which needs a lot of support from our computer technology, as it is achieved by different programming languages. What's more, I think python will be the most popular language among those programming languages, the reason is that python is perfect for non-professional programmers. However, since I am a professional programmer, I will not select python as my future programming language. I think java will be a better choice for me. And I make a investigation on https://trends.google.com between Java and Python. To my surprise, Python is much more popular than I think, as the interest over time line chart shows that python is much more interested by programmers over the whole last year both in Sweden and China. However, there is still some counties in Sweden more love with Java, such as Kroneberg and VÃ¤sternorrland. I will recommend java to my potential employer and my next large project because I think java is a great important part in daily programming, and JVM is very useful. Today I learn much from https://trends.google.com about java and python. And I think I need to study harder for Java in order to get better understanding about Java.
