I know about techniques Git,GitHub and GitHub Pages before, but not know about Markdown. And I have tried to create websites before. My former github web page is https://y85959948.github.io/test/. However, it is written in Chinese instead of English. It is also a homework when I was just entered university in China. I think building a web applicaiton is very interesting. It is not so hard for beginners, so it will much easier for us to do that than some other appliacitons. However, if you want to develop a nice web application, your need to know a lot of basic knowledge, such as some web language, some fancy frameworks and so on. Today I review how to work with Git and GitHub, which is really useful for our future work. What is more, I learn to fork repo from other github developers, which is a basic way to study other's ideas. In addition, learning update my forked repo is also important. In addition, I must say thanks to GitHub. Thanks to GitHub that I can setup a website using GitHub Pages, which will benefit us a lot! It is Github that I can get to know other's fancy work and learn to work like them. At last, I think I still have a lot need to learn. Therefore, I need to work harder and harder so I can become better.

I have tried HTML and CSS before, but not JavaScript. As you can see in my former website, I use some HTML and CSS. I think HTML is the basic of a website, CSS and JavaScript serve for HTML. Because website can not be built without HTML elements, but can be built without CSS or JavaScript. However, a web page with CSS and JavaScript will be more beautiful and useful. They play an important roll in web pages. In my opinion, I think web server is always waiting for interacting. When a browser wants to interact with web server, it will send a request using HTTP protocol. After that, web server will send response to web browser. Finally, the browser and web server can interacts with each other. Today the most important thing I learned is how to use CSS and JavaScript with HTML. Because CSS and JavaScript especially JavaScript is really import in network programming. And CSS is more and more significant in website decoration. I think CSS is much more difficult than JavaScript, because it has a lot of parameters and it is not easy for beginners to use. While JavaScript looks a little easier than CSS, and I hope I could do well in CSS and JavaScript!

I do not have any previous experience of client side JavaScript before. It is my first time to use JavaScript for client side. I think JavaScript is an amazing programming language that it can make our website much more meaningful. However, the value passing and address passing of variables are determined according to the type of the object passed, and cannot be controlled by themselves in JavaScript, while some other languages such as PHP, all types can freely control whether their value is passed by value or by address. What's more, the core function in PHP is implemented using functions, but JavaScript is implemented by object method. I think my coding exercise today is not easy. Because my grade aim is 5, however, I am not sure if I could get 5 in the end. The reason is that I am not quiet sure if I have meet the requirements. Today I have learned how to implement client side using JavaScript, which makes client side much more meaningful. What is more, I have some difficult in fetching data from other website, which will cause No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' problem, and fortunately I use proxy solve this problem. And I learn to use CSS to draw flags, it is really interesting. I hope I coule get grade 5 in the end~

I had not used node/npm before, because it is my first time to use JavaScript. But I have learned to use some other equal programming tools before, such as GCC for C language and Intellij for Java language. I think working with JavaScript, Node and Express is not easy, because I am not familiar with these things, but I will try my best to do it. To be honest, I do not have a specific plan, maybe I will watch some youtube videos. Now I just do the tasks that the lab requires, and I find that this lab is pretty difficult, because it is my first time to try this kind of framwork. My aim for the grade is 5, this is a really difficult level, there is always a lot of things waiting for me to learn and use. It is not difficult for us to get 3, however, but not so easy to get 4 or more. Today I learned a lot about JavaScript for server side. What is more, I am getting more and more familiar with Node and Express, which will benefit a lot in the future work. In addition, I must say that this lab is the most difficult one amoung these labs. I think I need to work harder and harder so that I could get great grades.

I think PHP is not so difficult compare to JavaScript, maybe because I have tried this language before. When comparing to JavaScript, the value passing and address passing of variables are determined according to the type of the object passed, and cannot be controlled by themselves in JavaScript, while some other languages such as PHP, all types can freely control whether their value is passed by value or by address. What's more, the core function in PHP is implemented using functions, but JavaScript is implemented by object method. I think PHP is a very useful language, as we all know that PHP is the most popular language amoung these website programming languages. It is not difficult for beginners to study and use, so I will recommend it if someone would like to study a website programming language. My aim for this lab is to get 5, because I think this lab is not so difficult and our teacher had showed us how to solve these tasks, so I am satisfied with the result. Today I have learned how to use PHP language to implement CURD operations and set the common header or footer, which is really useful for website build in future work. However, I think I still have a lot need to learn after this lab. It is difficult to finish this lab without teacher's help. Therefore, I need to work harder and harder in order to get great grades.

I think the popularity of programming languages is normal because the society today is the age of information science. Therefore, I think it is a trends in the information age which needs a lot of support from our computer technology, as it is achieved by many different programming languages. What's more, I think python will be the most popular language among those programming languages, the reason is that python is perfect for non-professional programmers. However, since I am a professional programmer, I will not select python as my future programming language. I think java will be a better choice for me. And I make a investigation on https://trends.google.com between Java and Python. To my surprise, Python is much more popular than I think, as the interest over time line chart shows that python is much more interested by programmers over the whole last year both in Sweden and China. However, there is still some counties in Sweden more love with Java, such as Kroneberg and VÃ¤sternorrland. I will recommend java to my potential employer and my next large project because I think java is a great important part in daily programming, and JVM is very useful. Today I learn much from https://trends.google.com about java and python. And I think I need to study harder for Java in order to get better understanding about Java.

I will try to explain the platform .NET to a skilled programmer,but newbie to this Microsoft technology that it is a multilingual component development and execution environment, which provides a unified programming environment across languages. The purpose of the .NET framework is to make it easier for developers to build Web applications and Web services, so that applications on the Internet can use Web services to communicate.PHP and .NET, one for individuals (php), one for large-scale systems (of course, it is also possible to make small systems, but the resource consumption is relatively small). There is still a long way to go. The only real competition on the table now is The J2EE platform with java as the development language and the multi-language .Net platform with C # as the representative.Java's J2EE platform is superior to the .Net platform in the development architecture, but it is a bit worse in the types of technologies available. This lab is the most hard one I have experienced, and I hope I could get grade 4, although it is not a high grade, I will satisfied with it. Today I learned the platform .NET, how it works and how it completed. The most important thing I learned in this lab is to use MVC framwork, it is a really fancy framework and it is popular nowadays. I will try harder and harder to stduy better!

  Our group member are Yang Yu and Hanmeng Yuan. The websites we want to analyse are www.hkr.se, www.kth.se and www.chalmers.se. Since we are students, we are all interested in some school websites, therefore, as you can see, these three are all school official websites. After analysising these three websites we come out this data sheet. The first part of the data comes from the Devtools network tab, the second part comes from PageSpeed insights and the last part comes from Lighthouse. From this data sheet we could easily find that the hkr official website performs best while chalmers performs worst. I think one important reason to cause this result is that there are less people use HKR official website, howerer, it's a high time to improve chalmers official website. What's more, these three have one same character that their performance on desktop devices are all better than on mobiles. I guess the reason is that more people use desktop devices to view them so they focus on how to develop better for desktop devices rather than mobiles. For HKR official website my advice is to preload critical requests and make better use of pictures, such as sizing pictures appropriately and providing pictures in a new generation format. For KTH official website, besides the same picture suggestions for HKR, I think it would be better to use an efficient image coding. For chalmers official website, I think it has a lot to do besides the picture advice for HKR and KTH. For example, it needs to delay loading off screent pictures. In addition, it has to remove resources that block rendering. Avoiding multiple page redirects will be useful too.

<p>I think the most common security issue is injection especially SQL injection, fortunately, more and more people aware this issue and try to fix it. And the second common security issue in my opinion is XSS, becaues I think it is difficult to protect, since cross-site script itself is not always harmful. Then I think insecure deserialization is an important problem. Since I am a CTFer, this issue is involved in almost every competition. The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications is to keey an eye on popular vulnerabilities, and it is nessarity to invite professional security testers for security testing. What's more, the most important thing is to develop self security knwoledge. And learning to use some popular security tools such as SQLmap or Nmap to test own web application is also a useful way to protect it. Today I learned the top ten web application security risks and how does they work. Since I play CTF, I think this lecture is very interested and important to me. It is important to focus on the latest security vulnerabilities, the earlier you find the vulnerabilities, the more safe your web application will be. I gain a lot of security knowledge from this lab and I think maybe I will get better grades in later CTF competition, however, it still need a lot of effort and I will try my best.

  I started this project by using a PHP framwork named CodeIgniter. At first I try to implement the Admin part, and I came to the problem that it is difficult to connect the database. Then I found that the framework has it own sequences to use the database. I think this project is difficult because our team wants to get high grade and we are only two people in our team, so it is not an easy thing for us to implement this eshop so well, we could just complete the basic functions and meet the grade requirements. It did take us a lot of time to do because we need to do it from zero, and our lab is not easy too, so it is really hard for us to do both at the same time. I think it is a little easier to finish the basic requirements, such as get data from database or something else. However, it is not easy to build a protected administration part to the GUI to performs CRUD operations to the database. What's more, it is easy to build a single page, but when it comes to build a whole project, it comes to a lot of things for us to consider, we always meet some small troblems when transfer data between server side and client side. And I think it feels good to work in a team, because we could help each other and imporve both of us. We always heard that 1+1>2, it is true in team work. I think this course material is sufficient and the guide for us to learn this course is clear. However, I think maybe we could reduce some workload appropriately. Because as for me, I have another course and it has projects too, so sometimes I need to do one lab and two projects at the same time, it is not an easy thing for me to do so much work. But in order to get high grades, I must keep on hard working for a long time. But I still really satisfied with this course, because it provides much knowledge I want to learn, I really gained a lot. I will recommend the course to my friends because I think the knowledge this course contains deserve us to pay a lot of time to study and we will not be regretted after learning this course. I will give this course grade 8. Although there are some parts need to improve, it is still a great course and I highly recommend it. At last, I hope I could get 5 grade in Lab3,4,5 and get 4 geade in Lab7 so I could get grade 5 in the whole lab part.
